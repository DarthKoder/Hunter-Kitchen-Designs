## Hunter Kitchen Designs

### Main Page
The main home page is the most important as this is the first page to grip the users interest and show them that this is where they want to be. For this reason, I wanted to keep the page modern, eye catching but yet subtle and I managed this by using an attractive image with neutral colours. I also gave it a zoom animation to draw the users attention along with the cover text to entice the users trust. The combination of this, along with the navigation bar and logo, altogether gives the user a welcoming feel for longevity and ease of use.

My motivation for this project was my parter, who is currently an up and coming kitchen designer and I wanted to create this site for her and the future of her career.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

### Existing Features

* Navigation bar
    * It is featured and fixed on all seperate pages.
    * This has been reduced down and been place in the center to flow with the layout of the rest of the page.
    * I have used the same "El Messiri" font for this to compliment the logo as well as stand out againg the majority "Exo" font that has been used throughout the site. 
    * It contains a dropdown menu for the kitchen related items for ease of use and user expreience.
    * I have used the same colour co-ordination with the teal like #009494 as the highlighted "active" page, whilst having the mouse hover turn the text to the teal #009494 but in the dropdown menus a background colour of dark grey #3b3b3b will also appear. This is to make the user aware of what page they are on and also actively see what page they are potectially going to next when hovering over, this hover change does not work on the page currently active.
    * I removed the navbar toggler and navigation bar when viewed on a smaller screen and put in a sidebar navigation for this function.
    * Includes links to the logo, home page, gallery, and sign-up page.
    * It is identical in design across the pages.
    * Allows easy navigation from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the "back" button.

    ![Navigation Bar](assets/images/navbar.png)

* Sidebar navigation 
    * The sidebar was used to tidy the screen up and input to increase user experience when used on smaller screens. 
    * It has all the same features and colourings as the navigation bar but it instead has a toggler situated in the top right corner and when activated the sidebar slides in from the right hand side of the screen and present the logo in vertical wording on the left hand side.
    * The navigation menu has the same features as the navigation bar, but is centered and in vertical format.
    * There is a "X" close button on situated on the right hand side of the logo text, you can also click anywhere else on the screen to close.

    ![Sidebar](assets/images/sidebar.png)


* Logo
    * I created something modern that stood out but was not to loud.
    * I used the "EL Messiri" font for this which seemed a nice fit and made it stand out against the main "Exo" font I used for the majority of the site.
    * The colours I used for this included a teal like colour #009494 which is the main colour I used for accenting the page along with the subtle dark grey #3b3b3b.
    * These colours are used throughout the site for recognition and user comfort.
    * It has been reduced when on smaller screen sizes along with being situated on the left with no slogan as to not make the screen too cluttered for user experience - this will reduce down to vertical wording it on very small screens similar to side bar layout.
    * The wording has been place vertically when used in the sidebar navigation system whitch uses the highlighted HKD well.
    * It has a minaimalistic attractive feel to it.

## Features Left to Implement

* The colouring was important to me and I wanted to emphasise the First letters of each work that can later shortened to HKD and possibly be used to create and emblem for the company. I envisioned this emblem as the capitalised letters being verticaly staggered in a steplike fashion.
* Add radio buttons to the form to highlight what type of kitchen the user is interested in.
* Updated gallery with additional images.
* Videos of previous projects.
* Reduce the size of images to make gallery load times better.

## Design

    * Primary colors used on the website: ![Color Scheme](/assets/images/HKD-colour-scheme.png)

 * Typography
    * Exo font is main font used throughout the site with sans-serif as its fallback font in case Exo doesn't import for any reasson.
    * The main logo, navbar & sidebar use the El Messiri font with the back up of sans serif in case any importing issues.
    * We also have the Dancing Script fomt for the page headings with a back up of sans serif in case of importing issues.

 * Wireframes
    * Figma: Easy to create, use and share detailed images whlst also effective.

## Bug fixes 

The navigation bar at first was situated on the left with a larger brand logo as the main home navigation and a toggler on the right when in a smaller screen. I removed the brand logo as it was not visually clean and I had trouble moving it along with the other nevigation text with Bootstraps design. The toggler was stuck at athe same height as the navbar which is situated under the logo text and this was not visually desireable, which was then replaced with the sidebar toggler which was then situated in line with the logo on the top right of the screen, this also came with its own issues. The issue I ran into with the sidebar and toggler was that with Bootstraps design, it was causing a column of whitespace down the right side of the page which I overcame by painstakingly tryihng to find out what Bootstrap css classes were causing this and I finally found the issues and resolved them using my custom CSS.

socials in footer margin responses to keep them inline when reducing screen sizes.
